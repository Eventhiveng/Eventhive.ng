          <b>5 years</b> of turning ideas into impact, building a brand that connects businesses with their customers, stakeholders, and opportunities. <b>Eventhive turns 5 today</b>, marking a milestone filled with resilience, innovation, and growth.
          Starting from humble beginnings, organizing student events straight out of university, we’ve grown to become a leading force in B2B2C events across Africa and beyond. Our mission has always been simple yet profound: empowering businesses to thrive through meaningful connections and impactful events.
          <br><br>
          <b>A Journey of Transformation</b>:
          <br>
          What started as a small idea has blossomed into a platform recognized for its ability to connect, inspire, and accelerate growth. Over the past 5 years, Eventhive has:
          <ol>
            <li>Expanded Across Borders: From Nigeria to the UK, and now extending to cities like Kigali and Johannesburg.</li>
            <li>Launched Flagship Events: Including the UK-Africa Business Outlook in London and the Nigeria Telecoms Forum, bringing together thousands of attendees and top industry players.</li>
            <li>Tripled Our Revenues: Welcoming over 30 new clients annually from diverse industries.</li>
            <li>Built Strategic Partnerships: Working with brands we once admired as students, like Shell, Interswitch and Quickteller, which are now part of our trusted network.</li>
            <li>Grown Our Team: With a presence in multiple countries, we’ve expanded our talented team of innovators and visionaries.</li>
          </ol>

          <br><br>
          <b>What We Stand For:</b>
          <br>
          At our core, Eventhive bridges businesses and their markets through expertly curated exhibitions, brand activations, thought leadership, and media visibility opportunities. Our events are designed to do more than connect; they inspire innovation and open doors to new possibilities via face-to-face events.
          <br><br>
          
        </p>
    
        <blockquote>
          From humble beginnings to becoming a trusted bridge for businesses across Africa and beyond, Eventhive’s journey over the last 5 years has been nothing short of transformative. We’ve grown not just in numbers but in impact, forging partnerships, creating opportunities, and driving innovation. As we step into the future, we remain committed to empowering businesses, fostering connections, and shaping the narrative of Africa’s growth through world-class events.

            <br>

            <br><br>
            <b>Gratitude:</b>

          <b>3 years</b> of leading efforts of the people behind <b>Eventhive</b>. <b>Eventhive turns 3years old today</b>. 
          <b>Graduating from university</b>, with no certainty as to the next steps is definitely one reality every young people face. Trust me, I wasn’t exempted. Though, I found a path quite quickly, one that has led me to founding <b>Eventhive</b>.
          <br><br>
          For one, <b>leading the efforts of the people behind Eventhive has been a combination of challenging and exciting experience</b>, but definitely one that I have constantly looked forward to exploring. <b>I appreciate our clients, team and friends</b> who have extended their very kind support since we kickstarted this journey of <b>developing Africa’s businesses via face-to-face events</b>.
          <br><br>
          Entrepreneurship tends to keep you on your toes at all time, especially when you are serving businesses across various sectors with their respective needs. <b>The most exciting and scary part of leading Eventhive</b> <em>is the anxiety that comes from waiting on responses from brands after pitching proposals</em>; <b>people working in the B2B space</b> have keen understanding of how this works.
          <br><br>
          Starting out from university, <b>hosting small-capacity student events</b>, I never imagined <b>hosting an event in London</b> or working with the category of <b>clients that have trusted us in the past 3 years</b>. Since registering <b>Eventhive in late 2019</b>, and getting <b>our first client, Max</b>, we have continued growing and tackling the challenges, head-on, one leap at a time.
          <br><br>
          In my few engagements with friends, when asked what makes me proud, my responses <b>are largely tied to the hardworking team who has driven the vision in the last 3 years, doing the most and staying consistent with our mission of helping businesses connect with their target market through our B2B2C events.</b> Thank you <b>Malik, Ezekiel, Tosin, Mustapha, Precious and Hussain.</b> You guys are the best 👏!
        </p>
    
        <blockquote>
            It will interest you to know that some of the companies we dreamt of working at while in the university are now our partners on a <b>B2B level</b>. A typical example is <b><a href="https://www.shell.com.ng/">Shell</a></b> with whom we have built a strong business relationship and partnership.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            <b>As undergraduates</b>, we were paying our school fees through <b>Quickteller, now we work with Quickteller and Interswitch as partners,</b> helping them reach their target customers and stakeholders through our multiple sector-focused events. This is really an interesting experience for us, and we can’t wait to gain more territories.
        </p>

        <br><br>
        <p>
            <b>For us at Eventhive</b>, our mission is really simple. <b>We enable businesses to grow through connecting them with their customers, stakeholders, knowledge, ideas, and opportunities.</b> We make this happen through the <b>exhibition, brand awareness, media visibility and thought leadership opportunities</b> we provide to the clients that work with us, <b>through our multiple-sector events, across Nigeria, UK and Africa at large.</b> Businesses leverage on these opportunities to reach their market. <b>If you say we serve as the bridge between businesses and their market,</b> <em>then you aren’t wrong</em>.
            <br><br>
            <b>In the last 11 months, Eventhive</b> has experienced faster growth than we projected, some of them are listed below;
            <br><br>
            1. We <b>3x-ed our annual revenues,</b> welcoming over <b>20 new clients</b> across the sectors we operate in.
            <br><br>
            2. We launched our flagship London event, <b>UK-Nigeria Business Outlook</b> which held in <b>Westminster, London,</b> in partnership with <b>Shell</b>.
            <br><br>
            3. We doubled our client base with <b>thousands of attendees</b> across various countries, participating at our events.
            <br><br>
            4. We onboarded more people into our team, with presence now in <b>Zambia and UK</b>.
            <br><br>
            5. We launched 3 new events;
            <br>
            <b><a href="https://fintech.eventhive.ng/">Nigeria Fintech Forum</a></b>
            <br>
            <b><a href="https://uk.eventhive.ng/">UK-Nigeria Business Outlook</a></b>
            <br>
            <b><a href="https://us.eventhive.ng/">US-Nigeria Business Outlook</a></b>
            <br><br>
            6. We forged <b>new strategic partnerships</b> with various organizations, with keen interest in strengthening our grip across the business communities.
            <br><br>
